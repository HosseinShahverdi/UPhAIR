{"Paper_on_Age_and_Glioma": "Age is a significant prognostic factor in glioma. Older patients, typically over 55, are more likely to have IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, which is associated with a poorer prognosis. In contrast, IDH-mutant gliomas are more common in younger patients.", "Paper_on_MGMT_in_Glioblastoma": "O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation is a key biomarker in glioblastoma. Methylation silences the gene, leading to better response to temozolomide chemotherapy. MGMT methylation is more frequently observed in IDH-mutant gliomas.", "Paper_on_Radiomics_Sphericity": "Radiomic features quantify tumor characteristics from medical images. Tumor sphericity, a measure of how spherical a tumor is, has been linked to prognosis. Lower sphericity, indicating a more irregular shape, is often associated with more aggressive, infiltrative tumors like IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.", "Paper_on_GLCM_Features": "Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features describe tumor texture. High cluster prominence can indicate heterogeneity and structural complexity within the tumor, which may be characteristic of high-grade gliomas."}
